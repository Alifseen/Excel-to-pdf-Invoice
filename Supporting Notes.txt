Section 25
Think of User:
think of user when creating a program
If alot of people will use it, then you should have a GUI or webapp, otherwise CLI is fine.
Usually automation programs are written as scripts.

Input vs Output:
For front end you have a visual design to follow, so you can plan your code according, but that is not the case in backend. So the trick is to write pseudo code starting from input and output, then adding things in between


MultiCells:
So far, we have only added single-line cells to a PDF using the pdf.cell() method. However, that method does not work for bigger pieces of text that expand across multiple lines. For such text, you should use the multi_cell method:

pdf.multi_cell(w, h, txt)



Here is a complete example for you to try. The code will generate an output.pdf file with multiline text inside.



from fpdf import FPDF

pdf = FPDF(orientation="P", unit="mm", format="A4")
pdf.add_page()

content = """
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing
elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore
et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,
quis nostrud exercitation ullamco.
"""

pdf.set_font(family="Times", size=12)
pdf.multi_cell(w=0, h=6, txt=content)
pdf.output("output.pdf")
